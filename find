🎮 Overview
Find the Blockchain is a fun, daily mini-game built with React and Vite! Each day, a "winning" blockchain is randomly selected from a curated list of popular ones (like Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and more). Your challenge? Guess which one it is in as few attempts as possible.

Daily Reset: A new winner every 24 hours – perfect for a quick daily check-in.
Simple Mechanics: Input your guess, get feedback (e.g., "Too early/late in the alphabet" or direct hints), and reveal the answer at the end.
Educational Twist: Learn about different blockchains while playing!

This project started as a basic React + Vite template and has been enhanced with game logic, UI polish, persistence (via localStorage), and mobile responsiveness. Whether you're a crypto newbie or a blockchain pro, it's a lighthearted way to engage with the ecosystem.
Why this game? In a world of complex DeFi and NFTs, sometimes you just need a silly guess-the-word-style game... but with chains!
